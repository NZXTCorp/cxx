This directory contains CXX's C++ code generator. This code generator has three
public frontends, one a command-line application (binary) in the *cmd* directory
a library intended to be used from a build.rs in the *build* directory, and
a library intended to be used from arbitrary other places (e.g. higher-level
code generators) in the *lib* directory.
